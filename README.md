# RAG-AI-assistant
Designed and implemented a custom RAG-based AI assistant using vector search, multilingual embeddings, and open-source LLMs, integrated with a user-facing UI.

# RAG-Based AI Assistant (Custom LLM Project)

This is a real-world AI assistant built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).  
It combines vector-based search (with FAISS) and open-source LLMs (like FLAN-T5 or GPT-Neo)  
to answer user questions based on private datasets (PDFs, articles, knowledge base, etc).

## Modules (To Be Built)
- [ ] Embedding Engine
- [ ] Vector Store
- [ ] LLM Answer Generator
- [ ] Prompt Templates
- [ ] Streamlit UI

## Goals
- Learn practical AI system architecture
- Create a working product (can be deployed/demoed)
- Understand how GPT-like chatbots work under the hood
